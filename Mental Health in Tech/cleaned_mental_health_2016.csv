"AT least at the places I have worked - IT in banking..it was a very macho hardass culture across the board. In nonprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...not as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was NO space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time.", I don't want to poison the well... people are prejudiced and in denial about their own issues and vulnerabilities I find...I wish I felt differently...,"Anxiety Disorder (Generalized, Social, Phobia, etc)|Mood Disorder (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, etc)|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",,"Anxiety Disorder (Generalized, Social, Phobia, etc)|Mood Disorder (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, etc)|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",least place worked bankingit macho hardass culture across board nonprofit spot budget tight everyone complained time hardnot hard untreated adhd depression anxietybut hard come previous workplace never feel safe bringing freelance deal structuring work hour etcbut really really struggling due isolation justfreelancing real grind didnt obamacare would completely screwed semi screwed also wish would ask survey caretaking female itand disabled take care elderly mother developmentally disabled brother never get discussed caretaking family someone break unable workits woman sister daughter mother please work caretaking survey question survey cant say meim water one helping brother motherleast father died penniless year wall street making million adhd tooand alcoholic depressedbut master universe type ipo tech companiesand liberatarian yeah please get intersectional survey landscape im screwed disabilitiesbut gender well sooo survey miss anything open question end two thing one adhd asset treated understoodalso finally got coverage work year agoi put med bad reaction work getting treated decade ended cratering worklife ten year wrong med really messed along wrong dx couldnt open serious breakdown workand fired immediately mercy understanding told going gone wasnt well couldnt defend became homeless im ok nowbut mess caused getting poor medical treatment pretty run mill depressioni silicon valley time female space anything less perfect one woman working sv time,dont want poison well people prejudiced denial issue vulnerability findi wish felt differently,anxiety disorder generalized social phobia etcmood disorder depression bipolar disorder etcattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,,anxiety disorder generalized social phobia etcmood disorder depression bipolar disorder etcattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,least place worked bankingit macho hardass culture across board nonprofit spot budget tight everyone complained time hardnot hard untreated adhd depression anxietybut hard come previous workplace never feel safe bringing freelance deal structuring work hour etcbut really really struggling due isolation justfreelancing real grind didnt obamacare would completely screwed semi screwed also wish would ask survey caretaking female itand disabled take care elderly mother developmentally disabled brother never get discussed caretaking family someone break unable workits woman sister daughter mother please work caretaking survey question survey cant say meim water one helping brother motherleast father died penniless year wall street making million adhd tooand alcoholic depressedbut master universe type ipo tech companiesand liberatarian yeah please get intersectional survey landscape im screwed disabilitiesbut gender well sooo survey miss anything open question end two thing one adhd asset treated understoodalso finally got coverage work year agoi put med bad reaction work getting treated decade ended cratering worklife ten year wrong med really messed along wrong dx couldnt open serious breakdown workand fired immediately mercy understanding told going gone wasnt well couldnt defend became homeless im ok nowbut mess caused getting poor medical treatment pretty run mill depressioni silicon valley time female space anything less perfect one woman working sv time dont want poison well people prejudiced denial issue vulnerability findi wish felt differently anxiety disorder generalized social phobia etcmood disorder depression bipolar disorder etcattention deficit hyperactivity disorder  anxiety disorder generalized social phobia etcmood disorder depression bipolar disorder etcattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,-0.996,Negative,United States of America
