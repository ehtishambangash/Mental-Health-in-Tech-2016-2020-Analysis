,tech is club where any sort of weakness is unacceptable.,"Last year I was dealing with an active episode of depression.  Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.","Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude",,A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it,,,,,,,tech club sort weakness unacceptable,last year dealing active episode depression nothing getting done couldnt focus anxiety going crazy felt like letting everyone making harder harder come office earlier year new working home policy brought company owner felt like stay keep trying despite getting progress made eventually discussing plan attack project manager met hr requested accommodation specifically little flexibility hour location work anxiety making working office impossible wanted able go home regroup couple hour make time later day week hr manager understanding allowed occur little followup time time ensure thing werent getting worse wasnt taking advantage situation additionally project manager manager ensured werent many ticket assigned backlog well reduce sense unending series task piling,identified knew going phase depression appreciated reacting kindly despite terrible attitude,,long difficult depression episode led dropping time month worked way,,,,,, tech club sort weakness unacceptable last year dealing active episode depression nothing getting done couldnt focus anxiety going crazy felt like letting everyone making harder harder come office earlier year new working home policy brought company owner felt like stay keep trying despite getting progress made eventually discussing plan attack project manager met hr requested accommodation specifically little flexibility hour location work anxiety making working office impossible wanted able go home regroup couple hour make time later day week hr manager understanding allowed occur little followup time time ensure thing werent getting worse wasnt taking advantage situation additionally project manager manager ensured werent many ticket assigned backlog well reduce sense unending series task piling identified knew going phase depression appreciated reacting kindly despite terrible attitude  long difficult depression episode led dropping time month worked way     ,-0.4255,Negative,Slovakia
