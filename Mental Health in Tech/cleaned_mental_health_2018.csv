I didn't do this until I knew that I was in a welcoming, supportive environment and my boss, who is the owner of the company, sets the tone himself by being a supportive, open person when it comes to those things like taking time to go to therapy or do other things that help them with mental health like meditate, exercise, or engage in other therapeutic activities (i.e. reiki, drawing, photography classes). People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments  ","I've talked with my coworkers about my mental health on more than one occasion. I try to be intentional and considerate when I have those conversations because it puts some emotional burden on them to hear it and because it is always a risk, even in a supportive environment.

But my anxiety symptoms are evident in my work and I think it helps others to know I am self-aware and am working on those issues. I think my coworkers have always been supportive and understanding.","I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others.

(My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...)",,"It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work.","I had many informal, personal conversations with one coworker -- they are my BF now, ten years later - about mental health because we had a lot in common.

After the accommodation was made, this person was labeled a trouble-maker by the executive staff and a careful, strategic effort was made to push this person out. Their title and job description were changed and they were soon put on a performance plan when in the past they had received only positive reviews. They saw the writing on the wall and found employment elsewhere.

"If it directly impacted my job, I would be more willing to divulge such information. But I would be wary of perceived or actual judgment and/or discrimination at the hands of my employer.

In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. ","My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job. I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy.

At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed.","The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently.","We both suffer from anxiety, so it was more of a conversation of us relating to each other and mental blocks we encounter because of it.",,,,"Be considerate in regards to an employee's mental health. Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills.","My supervisor is old-fashioned and sways towards conservative beliefs. After I revealed that I was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving treatment, I think she expected that I would become a stereotypical, normal employee who did not have a mental disorder. I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee.","I revealed my ADHD diagnosis to my supervisor and boss shortly after I received the diagnosis. It wasn't until months after that I read that most employees don't discuss their mental health with their superiors. I'm not sure if I regret discussing my mental health with my superiors. Taking into account their upbringing, and the area that I live in which is more traditional/conservative, I would think that I would have regretted it. But, I've strove to be an advocate for mental health, and strove to help reduce the stigma associated with mental issues, and strove to help people accept and understand that mental issues are real and not trivial.

He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized.","They are too many to describe.
