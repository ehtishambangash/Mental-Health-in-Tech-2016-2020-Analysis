We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",,,cross bridge come much information ahead time beneficial,reason bring information required,,,,simple could direct moment ok fired said needed therapy probably treatment stress level ok even wasnt ok didnt option therapist directed doctor got treated solid great decision helped extremely,coworkers friend talk productive wereare supportive,,software engineer depression mental illness almost equivalent disability brain working properly yo work need look issue side one employee another employer company need meet deliverable earn pay employee employee need time heal perform better help company grow taking consideration perspective cant really blame neither company employee fix answer based experience physical health important body well mind well healthy diet sport part every company incentive healthy life burnout stressed software engineer surely burn quickly stress source come many place come work demand unreasonable deadline developer working hour week constant basis burning matter time knowing burnoutstress issue employee company must address properly culture one speaks personally one issue environment poisonous culture generated development team improper leadership clique add bad culture lead stress unfortunately easy fix culture company bad better leaving clear expectation issue identified treatment progress important company employee clear expectation stress generated expectation laid start surely add illness,,,cross bridge come much information ahead time beneficial reason bring information required    simple could direct moment ok fired said needed therapy probably treatment stress level ok even wasnt ok didnt option therapist directed doctor got treated solid great decision helped extremely coworkers friend talk productive wereare supportive  software engineer depression mental illness almost equivalent disability brain working properly yo work need look issue side one employee another employer company need meet deliverable earn pay employee employee need time heal perform better help company grow taking consideration perspective cant really blame neither company employee fix answer based experience physical health important body well mind well healthy diet sport part every company incentive healthy life burnout stressed software engineer surely burn quickly stress source come many place come work demand unreasonable deadline developer working hour week constant basis burning matter time knowing burnoutstress issue employee company must address properly culture one speaks personally one issue environment poisonous culture generated development team improper leadership clique add bad culture lead stress unfortunately easy fix culture company bad better leaving clear expectation issue identified treatment progress important company employee clear expectation stress generated expectation laid start surely add illness  ,0.9504,Positive,United States of America

I suffer from tinnitus in my right ear and it drowns out people's voices if they speak at a low volume. Certain sounds like the humming sound in a server room or the high pitched sounds from some electronic devices aggravate the issue. I also like to wear headphones and listen to sounds that numb the condition. In my experience it's best to make people aware of the issue so that they don't think I'm not listening to them if the environment sounds are drowning out their voice or that I'm ignoring them and want to be left alone simply because I'm wearing headphones.,Personally I would like to think that I would be open to discussing a mental health issue with a future employer. It would all depend on the individual(s) I was facing and whether I thought they were comfortable with hearing about it. My wife has been dealing with a mental health issue since childhood and has hidden it from her own family. I have tried to talk to some of her siblings regarding the issue and they don't really want to know or aren't comfortable with the subject and shut down the conversation immediately. This experience has made me keenly aware that it isn't a subject matter that everyone is happy to hear about and I wouldn't expect an interviewer to be different.,,,,,"I told them that felt like I was an impostor, that I was stealing a living because I was unable to concentrate and focus on my job. Thoughts and concerns about my family were constantly distracting me. They were supportive and revealed that they themselves were dealing with depression and had been for years, the medication they were taking dulled the anxiety but also their ability to concentrate and focus so it took them longer to complete tasks. It made me feel better that I wasn't alone in what I was experiencing but also more determined to not look to medication for a solution.",A colleague once told me that they had almost committed suicide on the way to work that morning when they were crossing a bridge. It came as a complete shock to me to learn that they had been dealing with depression for longer than I had known them (6+ years) and such thoughts were a regular occurrence for them but this was the first time they had acted upon them. If it hadn't been for the intervention of a passerby they would have thrown themselves into the river.,"Take an active interest in the person and tailor the approach to the needs of the individual. One size fits all offerings of gym membership and health insurance is nothing more than a HR box ticking exercise. Providing access to counseling services would probably be more beneficial. In 26 years of being in the industry I have never once availed of the services of a gym. I used to cycle to work every day and it was great physical exercise and also a chance to clear my mind. In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago. Helping people identify and deal with issues they are experiencing would be of huge benefit to an organisation.

my physical health issues do not affect my ability to show up to work on time and focus during he day,I would bring it up so that I could negotiate for part time work at the offer phase. I would rather work part  time than try to fight my way through the medical/legal system,"My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation.","I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis.",,,"This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally.",,reduce stigma. offer options for part time work. not use an EAP as their only mental health coverage.,,"I've had to drive all of the progress in mental health insurance coverage at my workplace. Before I joined they only offer short term EAP help (designed for grief or a stressful event), and did not offer coverage for an ongoing mental illness.
